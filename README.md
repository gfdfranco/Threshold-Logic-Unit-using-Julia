# Threshold-Logic-Unit-using-Julia
shows an implementation of the firstand  simplest  neuronal  model,  using  Delta  rule  to  optimize  theinputâ€™s weights. The aim is to implement from scratch delta rulealgorithm  using  Julia,  this  technique  is  even  before  perceptronmodel,  but  It  could  help  to  understand  the  basic  concepts  andhow  to  start  programming  in  Julia.
